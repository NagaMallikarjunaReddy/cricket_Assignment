        <p>Virat Kohli ( born 5 November 1988) is an Indian international cricketer and the former 
           captain of the India national team who plays as a right-handed batsman for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the IPL and for the Delhi in 
           Indian domestic cricket. Widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time,[3] he holds the records for scoring most runs in T20 
           internationals and in the IPL. In 2020, the International Cricket Council named him the male cricketer of the decade. Kohli has also contributed 
           to a number of India's successes, including winning the 2011 World Cup and the 2013 Champions trophy.Born and raised in New Delhi, Kohli trained 
           at the West Delhi Cricket Academy and started his youth career with the Delhi Under-15 team. He made his international debut in 2008 and quickly 
           became a key player in the ODI team and later made his Test debut in 2011. In 2013, Kohli reached the number one spot in the ICC rankings for ODI 
           batsmen for the first time. During 2014 T20 World Cup, he set a record for the most runs scored in the tournament. In 2018, he achieved yet another 
           milestone, becoming the world's top-ranked Test batsman, making him the only Indian cricketer to hold the number one spot in all three formats of the 
           game. His form continued in 2019, where he became the first player to score 20,000 international runs in single decade. In 2021, Kohli made the decision 
           to step down as the captain of the Indian national team for T20Is, following the T20 World Cup and in early 2022 he stepped down as the captain of the Test team as well.</p>
